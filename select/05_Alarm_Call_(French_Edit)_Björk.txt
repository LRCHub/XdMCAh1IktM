I have walked this earth and watched people
It doesn't scare me at all
I can be sincere and say I like them
It doesn't scare me at all

An-bithelafter-mer, an-yeah-hoh-oh
An-be-ja-a-a-ha-ha
You can't say no to hope, can't say no to happiness
It doesn't scare me at all

I want to go on a mountaintop with a radio and good batteries
And play a joyous tune and free the human race from suffering
It doesn't scare me at all

I'm no fucking Buddhist but this is enlightenment
A less room you give me the more space I've got
It doesn't scare me at all

An-chamel-after, an-yeah-hoh-oh
An-be-ja-a-a-ha-ha
You can't say no to hope, can't say no to happiness
It doesn't scare me at all

I want to be on a mountaintop with a radio and good batteries
And play a joyous tune and free the human race from suffering
It doesn't scare me at all

This is an alarm call so wake up, wake up now
Today has never happened and it doesn't frighten me
It doesn't scare me at all

An-bithel-after, an-yeah-hoh-oh
An-che-ja-a-a-ha-ha
You can't say no to hope, you can't say no to happiness
It doesn't scare me at all, it doesn't scare me at all
It doesn't scare me at all

It doesn't scare me at all, it doesn't scare me at all
It doesn't scare me at all, it doesn't scare me at all
It doesn't scare me at all
