Wo-oo-ooh hoh!
I have walked this earth
And watched people
It doesnt scare me at all
I can be sinsere
And say i like them
It doesnt scare me at all
An-bithelafter-mer
An-yeah-hoh-oh
An-be-ja-a-a-ha-ha
You can't say no to hope
Can't say no to happiness
I want to go on a mountain-top
With a radio and good batteries
And play a joyous tune and
Free the human race
From suffering
It doesnt scare me at all
I'm no fucking buddhist
But this is enlightenment
The less room you give me
The more space i've got
It doesnt scare me at all
An-chamel-after
An-yeah-hoh-oh
An-be-ja-a-a-ha-ha
You can't say no to hope
Can't say no to happiness
It doesnt scare me at all
I want to be on a mountain-top
With a radio and good batteries
And play a joyous tune and
Free the
A-human race
From suffering
It doesnt scare me at all
This is an alarm-call
So wake-up, wake-up now
Woo-oo-ooh!
Today has never happened
And it doesnt frighten me
It doesnt scare me at all
An-bithel-after
An-yeah-hoh-oh
An-che-ja-a-a-ha-ha
You can't say no to hope
You can't say no to happiness
Wo-oo-ooh!
It doesnt scare me at all, wo-oo-ooh! ...
