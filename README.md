# The Correspondents – Alarm Call

> **歌詞登録ステータス：プレーン歌詞のみ**

```
Where have you gone?
I am calling on you.
Your alarm call's on,
And I'm coming to your rescue.
I know exactly what to do,
I make the call and sit by you,
Check your heartbeat against
mine,
And mop your brow from time to
time.
Where have you gone?
I am calling on you.
Your alarm call's on,
And I'm coming to your rescue.
I'm the person by your side,
I'm your mentor I'm your guide,
Upon me you can rely,
When you're high and when you're
dry.
The irony is, that my recovery
is always slower than yours.
You're back on your feet in no
time,
When I'm left floored.
Haunted by the sound of your
alarm call.
Living in fear of your next
fall.
Where have you gone?
I am calling on you.
Your alarm call's on,
And I'm coming to your rescue.
I know exactly what to do,
I make the call and sit by you,
Check your heartbeat against
mine,
But there's no trace of it this
time.
Where have you gone?
I am calling on you.
My siren's on,
And there's so many things that
I need you to do.
I never asked when you were
here,
Because it seemed so crystal
clear,
That it was you who needed me,
That was the way it had to be.
Where have you gone?
I am calling on you.
My siren's on,
And there's so many things that
I need you to do.
Be my mentor, be my guide,
Show me when to run and where to
hide,
I know you would have known just
what to do,
With all the things a life could
throw at you.
My siren will remain on for
awhile,
Waiting soundproof, by a timid
little smile.
I'm still haunted by your alarm
call,
Without the fear,
Of your next,
Fall.
